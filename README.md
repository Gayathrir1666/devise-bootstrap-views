* Used Bootstrap responsive columns

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'devise-bootstrap-views'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Then you can install the required translations in your `config/locales`. Use [devise-i18n](https://github.com/tigrish/devise-i18n) â€” the best source for updated Devise translations. You can manually generate locale files by executing `rails generate devise:views:locale <chosen_locale>`:

``` sh
rails generate devise:views:locale it
```

will generate `config/locales/devise.views.it.yml`.

## Customizing Views

The `devise:views:bootstrap_templates` generator will copy all views to your application, so you can modify the files as you wish:

``` sh
rails generate devise:views:bootstrap_templates
```
